# Fruit World Checklist

## About
This application was created to solve a problem at Fortune Enterprises Ltd where
the director was required to go around to every Fruit World shop weekly to check
what stock they required. A problem presents itself when the director has to
write what each shop needs on a printed compact spreadsheet and from this
mistakes can easily be made from the point of recording to loading up the delivery
van or writing packing slips that go with deliveries.

I plan to solve this issue through recording data through a mobile web app and
automating the processes that follow in an attempt to minimize mistakes.
